# Connect4

This is my Connect4 game that I coded in Python. I made use of various python libraries such as PyGame and NumPy to work the logic of the game. I also used the Minimax algorithm to implement the artifical intelligence iteration of the game, and Alpha-Beta Pruning to make AI decision-making most efficient.
